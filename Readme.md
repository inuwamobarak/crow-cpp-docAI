build and run the Crow application. Open a terminal in the project directory and run the following commands:

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..
make

./crow-cpp-docAI


This will compile your C++ code, generate the executable my_crow_app, and start the Crow server. You can access the application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:8080.
